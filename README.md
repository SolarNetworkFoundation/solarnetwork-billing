# Development setup

For command-line builds to work, the `SolarNetwork/solarnetwork-build`
and `SolarNetwork/solarnetwork-central` repositories must be available in the 
same directory this repository is cloned to. If you already have those 
repositories checked out somewhere else, you can create symlinks to them, e.g.

```
solarnetwork-dev/
├── solarnetwork-billing/
├── solarnetwork-build -> ../../sndev/solarnetwork-build/
└── solarnetwork-central -> ../../sndev/solarnetwork-central/
```
